# Vidora - Safe & Spam-Free Video Conferencing Platform  

**Vidora** is an intelligent and secure video conferencing platform that focuses on **spam-free**, **toxic-free**, and **AI-moderated** communication.  
It is built to ensure **safe real-time collaboration** using advanced moderation techniques, contextual AI checks, and host-controlled meeting environments.

---

## Overview  

Vidora combines **real-time WebRTC communication**, **Socket.io-based signaling**, and **AI-powered content moderation** to create a platform that‚Äôs both **lightweight** and **intelligent**.  

Unlike conventional conferencing systems, Vidora integrates **multi-layer spam detection**, **NLP-based toxicity scoring**, and **adaptive cooldown management** to protect users from message floods, profanity, and unwanted spam bots.

## Core Technical Features  

###  Real-Time Architecture  
- **Frontend:** React.js + WebRTC + Socket.io-Client  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express + Socket.io)  
- **Transport Layer:** WebSockets (event-driven full-duplex communication)  
- **Database:** MongoDB (optional persistence layer)  
- **AI API:** Google Perspective API for NLP-based content analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Moderation System  

Vidora employs **13+ independent moderation and safety layers**, combining both **AI and rule-based filters** for comprehensive protection.  

| Layer | Description | Technology / Logic Used |
|:------|:-------------|:------------------------|
| **1. Room Mode Control** | Host can switch between `normal` and `restricted` modes. | Socket-level flag management |
| **2. Per-User Message Tracking** | Tracks last message timestamp and count per user to enforce limits. | In-memory object map |
| **3. Message Rate Limiting** | Restricts messages if sent too frequently. | Custom time-window throttle |
| **4. Duplicate Message Detection** | Blocks repeated messages (e.g. ‚Äúhi hi hi‚Äù). | Exact match check |
| **5. Fuzzy Similarity Detection** | Prevents near-duplicate spam using similarity ratio. | Levenshtein distance / string-similarity |
| **6. Profanity & Slur Filtering** | Detects and blocks offensive words in English & Hindi. | Custom profanity dictionary + regex |
| **7. AI Toxicity Analysis** | Uses NLP to detect toxicity, insult, threat, or spam. | Google Perspective API |
| **8. Spam Pattern Recognition** | Detects repeated short words or emojis. | Token length + pattern analysis |
| **9. Temporary Cooldown Enforcement** | Applies message send cooldown on repeated violations. | Timer-based blocking system |
| **10. User Warning Feedback** | Sends visible UI alerts (e.g. ‚ÄúPlease slow down‚Äù, ‚ÄúToxic message blocked‚Äù). | Socket event emission |
| **11. Time-Window Cleanup** | Removes stale user data to reduce memory leaks. | Interval cleanup logic |
| **12. Safe Broadcasting** | Only valid messages broadcasted to room members. | Conditional emit in `socketManager.js` |
| **13. Frontend Cooldown Timer** | Disables chat input temporarily after spam detection. | React state-driven countdown |

 **Result:** A spam-free, toxicity-resistant, high-integrity chat system within a live video environment.

## AI Moderation Layer  

### Integrated API  
**Google Perspective API**  
- Parameters analyzed:  
  - `TOXICITY`  
  - `INSULT`  
  - `SPAM`  
  - `THREAT`  
- Confidence scoring thresholds applied before accepting/rejecting messages.  

### Example Logic  
If `toxicity > 0.8` or `spam > 0.5`, message is auto-blocked and cooldown applied.
